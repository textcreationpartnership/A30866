            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nor did I attempt this Work upon any ſuch Motive, but purely that I was convinced that every Man is a Debtor to his Country and Profeſsion; and therefore could not but think my ſelf obliged in Duty to exert my utmoſt Efforts in ſome Service for the good of this Iſland, as lay moſt proper for my Poſt and Profeſsion, of which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectured, that <hi>a Collection of the LAWS</hi> would be moſt acceptable, eſpecially conſidering the numerous Diſadvantages daily ſuffered for want of it.</p>
            <p>But as the many Attempts formerly without Effects made towards ſuch a <hi>Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection,</hi> convincingly ſhewed the difficulty of the Task, ſo it did as manifeſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the general Benefit that was aimed at, and expected from ſuch a Performance, and thereby confirmed me in my former Opinion, and incouraged me to offer ſome In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timations of ſuch my Purpoſes and Deſignations to the <hi>Aſſembly;</hi> which found ſuch an Acceptation, as eaſily convinced me that I could not better acquit my ſelf of my Duty, than by a Tender of my Endeavours in that Service, whoſe good Opinion of my poor Abilities, and obliging Commands chiefly induced me to this Undertaking.</p>
            <p>Though I am ſufficiently conſcious I am not <hi>par Operi,</hi> yet hope this well intended Enterprize will give Life and Encouragement to ſome Abler Perſon to give it a fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing Stroak, and bring it to Perfection for the Benefit of this Place and Iſland, that hath produced and raiſed many great Eſtates to ſeveral Merchants, Mariners and Traders hither; and alſo conſiderable and great Revenues to His <hi>Sacred Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty,</hi> and which on a calm Enquiry into, and ſerious Conſideration of the Cuſtoms it payeth for its own Native Commodities Exported hence, the increaſe of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Trade and Navigation it cauſeth, the Seamen it thereby breedeth, the Conſumption of Goods of <hi>Engliſh</hi> Growth it maketh, will not be found leſs advantageous to the Crown of <hi>England</hi> than the beſt of His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s <hi>American</hi> Colonies. This may be a ſufficient Reaſon to hope, that ſince His <hi>Gracious Majeſty</hi> hath been pleaſed to grant the Power of making <hi>LAWS</hi> proper for the Conſtitution of this Iſland, conſonant and agreeable (as near as may be) to the <hi>LAWS</hi> of his Kingdom of <hi>England;</hi> That He will alſo from Your <hi>Excellency's</hi> Recommendation, extend His wonted Eſpecial Grace and Favour to Us in the paſsing the Act for the Printing and Eſtabliſhing of this <hi>Collection,</hi> which being intended for the Preſs, hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a ſtrict and full Examination (that it might be Correct) on the Oath as well of the <hi>Clerk of the Council</hi> from the Records there, and the <hi>Clerk of the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly</hi> from the Records of that Houſe; and alſo of a Committee of the <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> with the Inſpection and Approbation of the Honourable <hi>Francis Bond,</hi> late Preſident, and Honourable the Members of His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s <hi>Council</hi> here, with the <hi>Attorney</hi> and <hi>Sollicitor General,</hi> and now an Authority for its Impreſsion, by Your <hi>Excellency's</hi> paſsing the Bill for that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>This once Flouriſhing (but alas! now Withering) Iſle, being bleſt with Your <hi>Excellency's</hi> Auſpicious Preſence, cannot but with all Duty and Loyalty rejoyce in His <hi>Majeſty</hi>'s great Goodneſs to, and abundant Care of her, in his Election and Miſsion of a Perſon of Your Birth, Honour and Dignity to Govern her,
<pb facs="tcp:97458:5"/>
whoſe chief Delight conſiſts in an equal diſtribution of Juſtice, and a lively and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Execution of His <hi>Majeſty's LAWS,</hi> and muſt eternally be obliged with the utmoſt Gratitude, to acknowledge the Bleſsing ſhe hath already received from Your Indulgence and Care. You have already opened the long barr'd Gates of her Rights and Priviledges, reſtor'd her Ancient Charter, and given a new Life to her Laws. You have preſcribed and reconciled our late Animoſities and Diſcords, and happily ſetled Love and Union throughout Your Government, which ſeems Paternal, and Our Obedience to Your <hi>Excellency,</hi> bottomed rightly on Love, not (according to the Dreams and Conceits of the <hi>Hobbiſts</hi>) upon Fear. So that I cannot omit doing Your <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> that Juſtice, as to declare, You have imitated the moſt eminent and greateſt Examples, <hi>viz.</hi> Our Illuſtrious <hi>Edward,</hi> and Glorious <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> as well as the Learned and Great <hi>Juſtinian;</hi> and therefore may juſtly be ſaid to be the Life of our Laws, as well as a Pattern of Vertue and Honour. Nor is Your <hi>Excellency</hi>'s high Care and Regard to the Royal Prerogative leſs obſervable, by which means You may <hi>de Jure</hi> claim (becauſe you merit) the Dignity and Authority His <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty</hi> hath with ſo much Wiſdom and Judgment conferred on You.</p>
            <p>'Tis not any Thoughts I have of my own Performance, that tempted me to the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogance of prefixing Your <hi>Excellency</hi>'s Name, together with thoſe of the <hi>Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Council,</hi> and <hi>General Aſſembly,</hi> to this Treatiſe, but the Nature and Dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the Subject Matter. For who ſhould more rightfully Patronize the <hi>LAWS,</hi> than thoſe that gave them Being and Birth, and who preſerve them by an equal and warm Execution?</p>
            <p>How excellently fitted and adapted theſe <hi>LAWS</hi> are to the good Government of this Place, the many Years we have lived quietly, happily and ſecurely under their Directions and Injunctions, will give a moſt convincing Teſtimony, and irrefragable Argument, ſo as they may not improperly be called as well the Walls of the Colony as of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>LAWS</hi> are deſcribed by <hi>Cicero, de Legibus,</hi> to be the higheſt or chiefeſt Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon grafted in Nature, commanding the things that are to be done, and forbidding the contrary: And <hi>Forteſcue</hi> ſpeaking of the Statute Laws, gives them this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comiaſtick Definition, <hi>Lex eſt Sanctio Sancta, jubens honeſta, &amp; prohibens contraria;</hi> they are truly the univerſal Suffrages of Nature propagating Good, and impeading Evil. Without ſuch, Virtue would be without Reward, and Vice without Puniſhment. <hi>LAW</hi> is as the Soul in Government, that giveth it Life and Form, and is certainly the beſt Guard, as well of the King's Prerogative, as of the Peoples Darlings, <hi>Liberty</hi> and <hi>Property.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The greateſt Strength of Kingdoms, conſiſts in the goodneſs of their <hi>LAWS,</hi> they being the Nerves of the Body Politick, and are both Rules and Curbs to the Miniſters of Juſtice, to direct and keep them in the Paths of Honour and Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, and prevent all Arbitrarineſs in them, (whoſe Province it ſhould be to diſtribute Right, equally to Rich and Poor) and their Officers. Infinite are the Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits which accrew to thoſe that are Partakers of Good Laws; by which, <hi>Omne hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manum Bonum,</hi> our Lives and Fortunes are preſerved from Oppreſsion and Abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Power, our Poſſeſsions ſecured to Poſterity, and we in this delightful Iſland made ſafe and happy.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Edgar</hi> collected the Laws of his Kingdom, and gave them the Strength of a Faggot bound, when as before his time they were looſe and diſperſed. This gave him more Glory than the Sayling round his Iſland with a potent Fleet rowed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered Kings; and was the greateſt Action of him or his Predeceſſors for the Good of his Subjects, the Benefit whereof hath even reached this Age, and encouraged us to follow his glorious Example, by gathering together, and methodizing the looſe and ſcatter'd Laws into one Body, which is done in this Collection, the advantage of which, will (I doubt not) be largely experienced in a ſhort time by all the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants,
<pb facs="tcp:97458:5"/>
and may be of ſignal Uſe to all Merchants, Mariners and Traders hither, particularly to the Profeſſors and Practiſers of the Law in <hi>England,</hi> who have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly wanted them as Directions in Caſes upon which their Judgments have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired.</p>
            <p>And as our Laws are to be valued and preſerved as our chiefeſt Jewel, ſo in the framing them, the greateſt Care, Prudence and Conſideration ought to be had, that they be grounded on true and loyal Principles, always reſpecting and promoting what is right and juſt. No private Intereſt but the Common Good, ſhould be the end and motive of their Conſtitution; they ſhould alſo have the <hi>duos Sales</hi> the Lord <hi>Cook</hi> mentions as their neceſſary Ingredients, viz. <hi>Salem Sapientiae, ne ſint inſipidae, &amp; Salem Conſcientiae, ne ſint Diabolicae.</hi> They ſhould alſo increaſe rather in Goodneſs than in Number, which naturally produceth Amazement and Confuſion, if not Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. For the Government wherein an unanimous Accordance happens, is like a well furniſhed Quire, where all the Actions, Words and Various Sounds, yield and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a glorious Harmony.</p>
            <p>Thus it is evident how great the Benefits are which we receive conſtantly by good Laws; and thus it is alſo evident, that the want of ſuch Laws, or a lively Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of them, is inconſiſtent with the true Intereſt of Mankind, Men without Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment being worſe than Beaſts, as having greater means by the advantage of their depraved Reaſon to do more (yea and more) ſuperlative Miſchiefs, when let looſe to the Dictates of their Will, ſuch as Rebellion, Murther, Rapines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But as the Miſeries and Misfortunes are innumerable, which attend a People that have no Laws, ſo the Unhappineſs of thoſe who have good Ones is not much leſs, if they be kept from publick View and general Uſe; for in ſuch Caſe, what ſhall direct them to their ſeveral Duties? what encourage Obedience, what affright them from Obliquities and Tranſgreſsions? To obviate and remove all which Evils and Inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niences, is the prime End and Deſign of the Publication of this Tract.</p>
            <p>I fear I have too much treſpaſſed on Your Patience, and by this long Harrangue, rudely invaded thoſe Minutes which You know how much better to diſpoſe of, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore will detain You no longer, but to ſubmit this Piece (ſuch as it is) to Your <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's,</hi> and the Honourable and Worſhipful Gentlemens Patronage, with a Duty and Devotion becoming</p>

                  <hi>WHereas</hi> by Virtue of an Act of this Iſland beating Date the Two and Twentieth Day of <hi>March,</hi> One Thouſand, Six Hundred, Sixty and Six, <hi>It is</hi> Declared and Enacted, That all ſuch Acts and Statutes as have been made at any time heretofore in time of Kingly Authority, and ſtand unrepealed, ſhall be of full Force and Virtue: And that alſo in the ſaid Act it is Enacted, That we under-written ſhould with all ſpeed Collect and Compile together all the ſaid Acts and Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes, and that then they ſhould be fairly entred and enrolled in the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary's Office, and after publiſhed in the ſeveral Pariſh-Churches in this Iſland; as in and by the ſaid Act expreſsly and more fully appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Now we the Perſons</hi> by the ſaid Act appointed as aforeſaid, do certify, That the ſeveral and particular Acts and Statutes foregoing and comprehended in One Hundred Fifty and Three Sheets of Paper,<note place="margin">This Order in the Old Collected Laws was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted at the end of them.</note> are the only Laws and Statutes which we find either originally Made and Enact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or Revived, Collected, Amended and Confirm'd under the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his now Majeſty, or of his Royal Father, or Grandfather, of ever bleſſed Memories, and which we have Compiled to be Publiſhed ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſaid Act, as Laws of Publick Concern. And that all the Private Laws ought to be Enrolled, and ought to be of Force from their ſeveral Dates and Times (Two Acts only Excepted, wherein we the ſaid Commiſſioners cannot determine which of them is Valid) both Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting Cuſtoms on all the Commodities of this Iſland hence Exported, yet only one of them can be in force. The Firſt of which Acts is intituled, <hi>An Act Importing the Cuſtoms,</hi> &amp;c. Dated the Seventeenth of <hi>January,</hi> One Thouſand, Six Hundred and Fifty; which was Made and Enacted by Governour, Council and the Repreſentatives of this Iſland lawfully im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by Commiſſion from the Earl of <hi>Carliſle,</hi> thereto impower'd by Letters Patent from the King; and that Act we cannot ſay is Repealed, by reaſon that the other Act Dated the Twelfth Day of <hi>September,</hi> in the Year One Thouſand, Six Hundred, Sixty and Three, Importing the Cuſtom of Four and an Half <hi>per Cent.</hi> and intended to Repeal the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Act, is not free from Objections and Exceptions of ſeveral Perſons, who conceive the Aſſembly which conſented to that ſaid laſt Act, was an Aſſembly not legally continued at the time of making the ſaid Act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>We have</hi> therefore thought fit to make this Return unto his <hi>Excellency,</hi> Council and the Repreſentatives now aſſembled, to the end a Determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therein may be made, as to their Judgments ſhall ſeem meet. Dated the 18 of <hi>July,</hi> 1667.</p>

                  <hi>Be it Enacted and Ordained</hi> by the Authority aforeſaid, That in all caſes whatſoever, where any Negro or other Slave, by the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Proviſion of this Act ſhall ſuffer Death, then ſhall ſuch Juſtices and Freeholders, Colonel and Field Officers, who adjudged ſuch Negro or other Slave to ſuffer Death, immediately after Sentence thereof given, inquire by the beſt means they are able, of the Value of ſuch Negro or other Slave, in which Value they ſhall never exceed the Sum of Five and Twenty Pounds Sterling, for any One Negro or other Slave, and alſo the Damage of the Party injured, and make Certi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficate thereof to the Treaſurer for the Time being, therein requiring the ſaid Treaſurer to pay out of the Value of the ſaid Negro or Negroes, the Value of the Damage to the Party injured: And the Overplus if any be, to the Owner or Owners of ſuch Negro or other Slaves; and if there be no Party injured, then the whole Value to the Owner or Owners of the ſaid Negroes or other Slaves, and if there be no Party injured, then the whole Value of the Danger or Dangers of the ſaid Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groe or other Slave out of the Publick Treaſury of this Iſland. But in regard there are ſome Maſters and Owners of Negroes and other Slaves in this Iſland, who do not make ſufficient Conſcience of providing what is neceſſary for their Negroes or other Slaves, or allowing them time to Plant or Provide for themſelves; for which cauſe ſuch Negroes or other Slaves, are neceſſitated to commit Crimes contrary to the Law; and yet the ſafety of this Iſland requiring, that ſuch Negroes and other Slaves ſhall ſuffer as the Law hath appointed, rather than the poor Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of this Iſland be ruined, and driven from hence by their means. That therefore ſuch Maſters and Owners of Negroes and other Slaves whoſe neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of Negroes and other Slaves, makes them in ſome meaſure guilty of their Crimes, may not be countenanced therein at the Charge of the Publick.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be it hereby further Enacted</hi> by the Authority aforeſaid, That the Juſtices and Freeholders appointed as aforeſaid, to enquire into the Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue of ſuch Negro or other Slave as they ſhall ſentence to Death, ſhall alſo further enquire by Witneſſes examined on their Oaths, or by their good Information, how the Owner or Owners of ſuch Negro or other Slave,
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:97458:121"/>
condemned as aforeſaid, was provided with Proviſion and other Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and what Allowances thoſe Negroes and other Slaves had received. And if it ſhall appear to the ſaid Juſtices and Freeholders, or the Major part of them, that the ſaid Maſter or Owner had not provided rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably and as is generally accuſtomed for Negroes and other Slaves, and that neceſſity might have compelled the ſaid Negro or other Slave to the Offences they have committed, <hi>Then</hi> and in that caſe, the Juſtices and Freeholders as aforeſaid, ſhall certify the ſame to the Treaſurer afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, and only appoint the ſaid Treaſurer to pay the Damage to the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty injured, out of the Value of the ſaid Negro or other Slave, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to ſuch Maſter or Owner. And if the Treaſurer for the time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (having ſufficient Publick Stock in his Hands) ſhall fail to make Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction and Payment to ſuch Maſter or Owner of any Negro or other Slave, he having the Governour's Warrant for the ſame, the Party injured ſhall have an Action of Debt upon ſuch Certificate as aforeſaid, againſt the ſaid Treaſurer in the Court of Common Pleas for the Precincts of St. <hi>Michael</hi>'s, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And the Treaſurer being thereto duly ſummoned, ſhall at the Firſt Court after Summons, plead and come to Tryal, or elſe Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to paſs againſt him by Default; and after Judgment, Execution im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to iſſue for Satisfaction. And in regard the Planters neceſſity doth compel them for the Managemnt only of their Lands, to keep ſo vaſt a Stock of Negroes and other Slaves, whoſe deſperate Lives and great Numbers become dangerous to them, and all other the Inhabitants. That therefore ſuch who are not bound up by that neceſſity in having Plantations of their own, and hired Land, may not increaſe the danger to this Iſland, by keeping Negroes or other Slaves to hire out to others,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be it therefore Enacted</hi> by the Authority aforeſaid, That no Perſon of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nation reſiding in any Sea-Port Town of this Iſland, ſhall keep or imploy any Negro or other Slave, be he Man or Boy, for any Uſe or Service whatſoever, more than one Negro or other Slave, Man or Boy to be allowed to each of the Perſons of the ſaid Nation, except ſuch as are Denizen'd by His Majeſty's Letters Patents, and not otherwiſe, who are to keep no more than for their own uſe, as ſhall be approved by the Governour, Council and Aſſembly: And if any Negro, Man or Boy, more than is before allowed by this Act, ſhall be found Three Months after Publication hereof, in the Cuſtody, Poſſeſſion or Uſe of any the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons aforeſaid, then every ſuch Perſon or Perſons, ſhall forfeit ſuch Negro or other Slave, one Moyety of the Value thereof to whomſoever ſhall inform, and the other Moyety to His Majeſty, to the Uſes in this Act appointed.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And whereas</hi> divers Negroes and other Slaves at this preſent are, and have been long ſince run away into Woods and other Faſtneſs of this Iſland, doing continually much Miſchief to the Inhabitants of this Iſland, hiding themſelves ſometimes in one Place, and ſometimes in another, ſo that they are not to be found without much difficulty,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Be it therefore Enacted,</hi> That from and after Publication hereof, it ſhall and may be lawful for any Juſtice of the Peace, Conſtable or Captain of a Company within this Iſland, that ſhall have notice of the Reſidency or Hiding-place of any Run-away Negroes, or other Fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Slaves, to Raiſe and Arm any number of Men, not exceeding Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, to apprehend and take them, either Alive or Dead. And for every Negro or other Slave that they ſhall take alive, having been run away above Six Months from his Maſter, they ſhall receive Fifty Shillings Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling; and for every Negro or other Slave that they ſhall take alive, having
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:97458:122"/>
been run away above Twelve Months Five Pound from the Maſter or Commanders of the ſaid Negro or other Slave; if killed in taking, they ſhall receive Fifty Shillings Sterling from the Publick; any Act or Statute heretofore to the contrary notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And it is further Enacted and Ordained</hi> by the Authority afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid, That if any Negro or other Slave under Puniſhment by his Maſter or his Order for running away, or any other Crimes or Miſdemeanors towards his ſaid Maſter, unfortunately ſhall ſuffer in Life or Member, which ſeldom happens; no Perſon whatſoever ſhall be liable to any Fine therefore. But if any Man ſhall of wantonneſs, or only of Bloody Mindedneſs, or Cruel Intention, willfully kill a Negro or other Slave of his own, he ſhall pay into the Publick Treaſury, Fifteen Pounds Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling: But if he ſhall ſo kill another Man's, <hi>He ſhall pay</hi> to the Owner of the Negro, double the Value, and into the Publick Treaſury, Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Five Pounds Sterling. And he ſhall further by the next Juſtice of the Peace, be bound to the good Behaviour during the Pleaſure of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernour and Council, and not be liable to any other Puniſhment or Forfeiture for the ſame; neither is he that kills another Man's Negro or other Slave by Accident, liable to any other Penalty but the Owner's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at Law. But if any poor ſmall Freeholder or other Perſon, kill a Negro or other Slave by Night, out of the Road or Common Path, and Stealing, or attempting to Steal, his Proviſion, Swine or other Goods, he ſhall not be accountable for it: Any Law, Statute or Ordinance to the contrary notwithſtanding.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And be it further Enacted</hi> by the Authority aforeſaid, That all the Fines and Forfeitures ariſing by this Act, ſhall be to His Majeſty for the uſe of this Iſland, according to ſuch uſes and proportion that in the afore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaid Clauſes are reſpectively appointed; and ſuch thereof as are not o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe limited and appointed in this Act, as are above the Sum of Five Pounds Sterling, ſhall be recovered by Bill, Plaint or Information, in any of his Majeſty's Courts of <hi>Record</hi> within this Iſland; and ſuch as are of the Sum aforeſaid, or under, ſhall be recovered before any Juſtice of the Peace within this Iſland, who is hereby required to grant Execution for the ſame, as in the caſe of Servants Wages, <hi>Provided</hi> the ſame be commenced within Thirty Days after the ſame be forfeited.</p>
               <p>
